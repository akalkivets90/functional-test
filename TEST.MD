# Programming Test

Given the following input array of people, please complete task 1 - 3. You should use functional programming and JavaScript and preferably a TDD approach to complete the tasks. Please use yarn as package manager, meaningful commit messages and create simple, modular code with functions (preferably modern ES6 JS).
Tests can be written using mocha, chai or jest.

Nice-To-Have's:
- Linting
- Standard Commit Message
- Fork this repo and make a PR to master, then add me as a reviewer
- Tests
- Maybe you have some other fancy ideas? ðŸ™ƒ

Please share your results via GitHub.

```
const people = [
  {
    name: 'Steven',
    children: [
      {
        name: 'Louis',
        children: [
          {
            name: 'Carl',
            children: [
              {
                name: 'Joseph'
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
];
```

### 1. Add `My name is: ` to all people entities.

Example: 

for Steven the result would be:

```
{
  name: 'My name is: Steven',
  children: [
    ...  
  ]
}
```

### 2. Add the name of the parent to each element as `parentName`. If there is no parent, simply don't add the attribute.

Example:

For Louis the result would be:

```
{
  name: 'Louis',
  parentName: 'Steven',
  children: [
    ...
  ]
}
```
